This currently has no function.
When it is finished, it will be an interactive GUI to convert an array of on/off pixels into an array of Hexcode, for use with a microcontroller  to write to LEDs.

Currently, it is a sandbox to learn Java and Swing, with potential to migrate to JavaFX or another API.

Currently there is no applicable functionality.

How To Use:
The top and left pane allows you to set the height and width of the array in the center.
Turning the toggle buttons in the center on/off, and pressing the "Update" button in the bottom pane, will convert the array into hexcode.
This makes writing to LED matrices much easier.

Thank you.
