What this tool does:
This is a GUI for translating a matrix of on/off buttons into Hexcode
This makes writing to LED matrices much easier.

How To Use:
Set the height and width of the matrix using the buttons along the top and left.
Draw the image you want translated on the matrix
Press the Update button. your code will appear on the right.

Known Issues
-Resizing frame will break fullscreen
-Enlarging frame does not update minimumsize (enfocing minimum size on framechange prevents frame from shrinking.)
-Central grid clears on Frame change & on text update

Thank you.
