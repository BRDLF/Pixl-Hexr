# What this tool does:
This is a GUI for translating a matrix of on/off buttons into Hexcode
This makes writing to LED matrices much easier.

# How To Use:
Set the height and width of the matrix using the buttons along the top and left.
Draw the image you want translated on the matrix
Press the Compute button. your code will appear on the right.
Press the Clear button to deselect all buttons in the grid.

# Known Issues
-Resizing frame will break fullscreen
-Enlarging frame does not update minimumsize (enfocing minimum size on framechange prevents frame from shrinking.)

Thank you.
